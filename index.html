            <p> Figuring out how to get the most basic stuff to work was painful. 
            <br> Especially when doing this after Christmas Vacation, haha.
            <br> Regardless, it's fun trying to build a website, even though you could barely consider this functional.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
            <p> I made this for a college project, but if all things go well, you might be reading it from an online database, too!
                <br> Thank god for Netify and GitHub, right?
                <br> Regardless, enjoy your stay!</p>

            <p> Hi! Eager to get to know me, eh?
                <br> Unfortunately this version of the website will not contain any of my socials for now.
                <br> Privacy, n' allat.
                <br> Main reason this doesn't have it's own page, after all.
                <br> I'll probably update this sometime in the future. Look forward to it.</p>
